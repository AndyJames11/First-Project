# Andrew Harvey's Portfolio Website

[View the live project here.](https://github.com/AndyJames11/First-Project)

This website is for my Milestone 1 project in my Web Development course with CodeInstitute. I decided to create a portfolio site which simply has some details about me, my CV, and some other things e.g. a simple Cafe Menu page, a link to my Discord Bot which I developed in JavaScript, and some pictures of my cup final game.

# User Experience (UX)

* ##  User Stories
    * #### First time visitor goals
        * As a first time visitor, I want to be able to clearly see what I am looking at. I want to be able to understand what the website is for and would like the page to be interesting.
        * As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate through the website and find the pages and information I am looking for without any difficulty.
        * As a first time user, I want to be able to find more information about the developer. I want to see social media links so that I can understand who built the site and what type of person they are.

    * #### Returning visitor goals
        * As a returning visitor, I want to find contact information for the developer so I can get in touch with them if I have any questions.
        * As a returning visitor, I want to see if the developer is looking for work.

    * #### Frequent visitor goals
        * As a frequent visitor, I want to see if there are any newly added pages or features.
        * As a frequent visitor, I want to see if there have been any new photos added or updates to the Discord Bot.

* ## Design
    * #### Colour Scheme
        * The main colours used in my portfolio are black and white. I think these colours look very sleek and modern and they tend to be very easy to read.
    
    * #### Typography
        * The fonts used in my portfolio are Lato and Oswald. Lato is the main font used, with some headers and the 'My Projects' logo using Oswald. I like both of these fonts and I think they are eye catching but also very clean and easy to read.

    * #### Imagery
        * I think the main image is very important for a webpage. It needs to grab the attention of the user without being too distracting from the content. For my landing page, I have chosen to use a picture of myself at a football match as I like the colours and makes gives the page feel warm. It also shows what I look like which is useful for recruiters, and it shows me doing a hobby so you get an idea about my personality. For the cafe page, I opted to use a minimalist, slightly blurred, real cafe image as I think it looks very modern and clean.

# Technologies Used

## Languages Used
* #### [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
* #### [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)

## Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
* #### [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    * #### FontAwesome was used to add the icons for my social links in the footer of the pages.
* #### [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    * #### Google Fonts were used to import the 'Lato' and 'Oswald' fonts into the CSS files. The fonts were used throughout the project.
* #### [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    * #### Git was used for version control by utilizing Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
* #### [GitHub](https://www.github.com/)
    * #### GitHub is used to store the project's code after being pushed from Git. It is also used to store the repo for my Discord Bot which is linked in the website.
* #### [ReplIt](https://replit.com/)
    * #### ReplIt was used to build the early versions of the webpage. The majority of the landing page was built in ReplIt until I switched over to CodeAnywhere as was suggested by CodeInstitute.
* #### [CodeAnywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/)
    * #### CodeAnywhere was used breifly to begin designing the Cafe page, however I ran out of development hours and so it was suggested by a CodeInstitute tutor that I switch to GitPod.
* #### [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
    * #### GitPod is the program I am using now for all of my coding for this project. It uses VS Code as its IDE and links to GitHub for code commits and pushing code.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera and Microsoft Edge.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 13.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and colleagues were asked to review the site and point out any bugs.

### Known Bugs

-   On some mobile devices, the floating text on the landing/home page covers a small part of the top Navbar.
-   On some mobile devices, scrolling down on the landing/home page can result in being unable to scroll back up the page.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AndyJames11/First-Project)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "Deploy from a branch" and select "main".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://andyjames11.github.io/First-Project/) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AndyJames11/First-Project)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/AndyJames11/First-Project.git
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/AndyJames11/First-Project.git

## Credits

### Code

-   The full-screen hero image and navbar code came from the LoveRunning activity in CodeInstitute

-   [CodeInstitute README.md sample](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME?tab=readme-ov-file) was very useful when writing this README file as it gave me prompts as to what I should add, and showed a good way of formatting the content. 

-   All content was written by me with some snippets of code coming from [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) and [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com). The code used was then edited with parts added/changed. Code that remains unchanged is shown below:

1.
```
* {
  margin:0;
  padding:0;
  border:0;
}
```

2.  [This code](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_two_columns.asp). Most of this has been edited, but the code that remains is:
```
.row {
  display: flex;
}

.column {
  flex: 50%;
}
``` 
and
```
<div class="row">
  <div class="column"></div>
  <div class="column"></div>
</div>
```

### Media

-   The image used in the landing/home page is of me from a charity football match. Photo was taken by a friend. [Link to full size image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53616615688_5a3a394b10_k.jpg).

-   The image used in the Cafe page was taken by Petr Sevcovic and was downloaded from Unsplash [here](https://unsplash.com/photos/people-inside-cafe-qE1jxYXiwOA)

-   The images used in the Gallery page were taking from our cup final on the 5th April 2024.

### Acknowledgements

-   My Mentor for continuous helpful feedback.

-   [W3schools.com](W3schools.com) and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) as I used both countless times to gain a better understanding of things such as background-position, floats, flexboxes etc.

-   Google was incredibly helpful for very specific things that I got stuck on during the project. I had to use Google many times to figure out why my code was not working or to figure out how to perform an action in CSS.

-   Tutor support at Code Institute for their support.
